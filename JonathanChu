            <p> Born in Argentina, and live there for around 10 years to later move to Mexico for other 10 years and finally 
            stay in Canada up to this day. 
                Very enthusiastic when it comes to videogame as well as computers. I joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma or something even higher. There is not a definite answer
                as for what he wants to learn yet but is eager to learn about it. </p>
